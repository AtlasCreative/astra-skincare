#### ABOUT

> ASTRA Skincare is a site made for demonstration purposes only. It's a custom front-end app for a Shopify webstore. The products, cart, and checkout object are all hosted on Shopify and interacted with through the Shopify Buy SDK and the Shopify Storefront API. This site acts as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the possibilities of having a custom, highly-responsive front-end for a Shopify webstore with all of the features of managing products, customers, orders, etc. via the store's Shopify Admin.

#### MOTIVATION

> This project was the first project that I collaborated with my partner on. Over two years ago I jokingly said to her that I should become a web developer so that we can make websites together. She is an incredible designer and the key reason why I am so proud of this project. I love programming and creating functionality but when the end result is so beautiful to look at, I think it makes it 10 times better.

### MORE

> Check my [developer blog](https://cjfritz.dev/blogs) about this project for more about what I learned and the tools that I used to streamline design to development, from Figma to VSCode using powerful tools like Chakra UI's Figpilot & more.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Technologies Used

##### TypeScript

<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/typescript/typescript-original.svg" alt="typescript" width="40" height="40"/></a>

Who doesn't love TypeScript? As someone born with the "memory of a developer" I can't even fathom the number of times TypeScript has kept me from forgetting function names, parameter types, or variable names.

---

##### React

<a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/react/react-original-wordmark.svg" alt="react" width="40" height="40"/></a>

Ever heard of it? üòâ

##### Chakra UI

<a href="https://chakra-ui.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://images.opencollective.com/chakra-ui-pro/61bd1dd/logo/256.png" alt="chakra-ui" width="40" height="40"/></a>

Chakra UI + FigPilot allowed me to streamline Jeana's designs in Figma to code with ease. I was able to generate Chakra components directly from Figma and create custom components, themes, and variants for the entire website - saving me an incredible amount of time.

##### Framer Motion

<a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://e1.pngegg.com/pngimages/188/872/png-clipart-macos-app-icons-framer.png" alt="framer-motion" width="40" height="40"/></a>

Framer Motion is a great animation tool and integrates well with React and Chakra UI and also ships with some very handy hooks, such as the "useInView" hook.

##### Shopify Buy SDK

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/shopify-buy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://brandeps.com/logo-download/S/Shopify-logo-vector-01.svg" alt="shopify-buy-sdk" width="40" height="40"/></a>

We created a Shopify webstore together, created a custom App, and hosted all of our products and checkout that is interfaced with via this custom front-end and Shopify's developer tools.

##### ChatGPT

<a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2QXCv40cUDNEeZqviEJGdITx6tVEYScVi4tFWaJY4ckLei2ggsIxVZPLqAj1IITIlZh9" alt="chat-gpt" width="40" height="40"/></a>

ChatGPT wrote all of our blog articles, formatted them into JavaScript objects, wrote the disclaimer, FAQs, and even named a product.
