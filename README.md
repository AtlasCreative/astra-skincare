### ✨ [Demo/Homepage](https://www.astra-skincare.com)

> ASTRA Skincare is a site made for demonstration purposes only. It's a custom front-end app for a Shopify webstore. The products, cart, and checkout object are all hosted on Shopify and interacted with through the Shopify Buy SDK and the Shopify Storefront API. This site acts as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the possibilities of having a custom, highly-responsive front-end for a Shopify webstore with all of the features of managing products, customers, orders, etc. via the store's Shopify Admin.
