            ASTRA Skincare is a company founded on the belief that skincare
            should be accessible and effective for all. Our mission is to
            empower individuals to feel confident and beautiful in their own
            skin, and we achieve this by providing high-quality, affordable
            skincare products.

            Our founder, Beth, struggled with acne-prone skin for years, and she
            tried countless products that either didn't work or were too
            expensive. Frustrated with the lack of options, Beth decided to take
            matters into her own hands and create a skincare line that catered
            to all skin types and concerns.

            deserves to feel confident and beautiful, and our skincare line
            reflects that belief. Our products are formulated with high-quality
            ingredients that are gentle yet effective, and we strive to use
